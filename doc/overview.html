  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>Task 1 description of the VTS software.</p>
  <p>To use the VTS software, you can simply type "./gradlew appRun" in your terminal under the project directory, then open your browser, copy and paste "http://localhost:7777/project/web_graphics/project.html" into it. Then you can adjust your settings in the left of the simulator website and click run to run this simulator.</p>
  <p>For configuration, you can simply edit the file under src/main/resources named config.txt. There are currently two routes in this file.</p>
  <p>If you want to check if there is any error in this project, you can run "./gradlew clean check" to check if there remains any code doesn't conform to the google java code style guidelines. Or you can check the javadoc docucumentation. To do this, first, type "./gradlew clean javadoc" in the terminal udner the project directory. Then you can open projectDir/build/reports/checkstyle/main.html then click on any parts to see the number of errors.</p>
  <h1>UML Class Diagram for Domain Classes</h1>

  <p>This diagram simply describes the files in the projectDir/src/main/java/edu/umn/cs/csci3081w/project/model. Bus class contains all the information of the bus, including the name of the bus, route in, route out, capacity of the bus and the speed of the bus. BusData stores the basic information of a bus and how to get the parameters of the bus. For the other classes like Stop, Route, they simply do the same thing as well as the StopData, RouteData. In general, random passengers will be generated by RandomPassengerGenerator under the PassengerGenerator. If a passenger wants to get on a bus, he/she has to wait at the stop and be added to the passenger list of this certain stop, then once the bus arrives, passenger can choose to get on the bus or wait at a stop if this is not the bus he/she wants to get on. At the same time, the time parameter of the passenger can be added by one. When the passenger gets at his/her destination stop, he/she can get off the bus, then the bus information can be updated because the number of people on the bus has been changed. Then if the bus runs its route fully, it quits the route on the map. </p>
  <h1>UML Class Diagram for Web Server Classes</h1>
  <img src="diagrams/webserver_diagram.png" alt="UML Class Diagram for Domain Classes" width="800" height="400">
  <p>ConfigManager stores the routes information, MyWebServerSession and Visualization reads the routes information from it; ResumeCommand, InitRoutesCommand, StartCommand, UpdateCommand, GetBussesCommand,GetRoutesCommand,PauseCommand are 7 types of MyWebServerCommand. VisulizationSimulator executes the StartCommand, UpdateCommand, PauseCommand,ResumeCommand order and use the simulator to follow the order; while GetBussesCommand and GetRoutesCommand read information from WebServer, InitRoutesCommand follow the ConfigManager rules.
  MyWebServerSession uses VisulizationSimulator, ConfigManager,MyWebServerSessionState.</p>
